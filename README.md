# Travel List

Welcome to **Travel List**, a simple React application built with Vite to help you keep track of your travel packing list. This project is inspired by Jonas Schmedtmann's React tutorial but with a twist: it uses Vite as the development environment, and the packing logic has been implemented from scratch.

**Note:** This project is not mobile-responsive as the primary focus is on React functionality, serving as a refresher for React development.

## Features

- **Create and Manage Your Travel Checklist:** Travel List allows you to add items to your travel checklist. For each item, you can provide a description and specify the quantity needed.

- **Check Items Off Your List:** Once you've added items to your checklist, you can mark them as packed by clicking the checkbox next to the item. Clicking the checkbox again will mark the item as unpacked.

- **View Packing Progress:** In the footer of the application, you'll find a stats section that displays the total number of items packed and the total number of items remaining to be packed. This helps you keep track of your packing progress.
